This is the main repo used to communicate to prospective Outreachy interns for the Mozilla DataScience team.

We would like prospectives to do the following:
1. Fork this repository and make a local copy on your machine.
2. Find an [issue](https://github.com/mozilla-outreachy-datascience/outreachy-datascience/issues) you would like to answer and add a comment tag your name to it.
3. Ask questions you might have about the issue in the tracker.
4. Write a script or create a notebook with detailed comments in Python or R that shows us how you answered the question.
5. Add that notebook to the folder `proposals` following the instructions in the `proposals/README.md`.
6. Submit a PR.
